# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification 🌿

This project is a Jupyter Notebook-based implementation for classifying plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The notebook demonstrates data preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and making predictions on new images.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify plant diseases from images using deep learning techniques. The notebook uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a CNN model, evaluates its performance, and provides a function for predicting the class of new images.

## 🚀 Project Description

This project focuses on building a CNN model to classify plant diseases into three categories: healthy 🌿, powdery mildew 🍂, and rust 🌰. The model is trained using a dataset of plant leaf images and evaluated on a separate test set. The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess the image data 📷.
2. **Model Building:** Define a CNN architecture 🏗️.
3. **Model Training:** Train the model using the training data and validate it using the validation data 🚀.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model’s performance on the test set 🔍.
5. **Prediction:** Predict the class of new images 🖼️.
6. **Visualization:** Plot accuracy and loss curves for model performance 📈.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `numpy` 🧮
- `tensorflow` 🧠
- `PIL` (Pillow) 🖼️
- `matplotlib` 📊
- `json` 📄

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow pillow matplotlib
```

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset).

The dataset should have the following directory structure:

```
Dataset/
    Train/
        healthy/
        powdery/
        rust/
    Validation/
        healthy/
        powdery/
        rust/
    Test/
        healthy/
        powdery/
        rust/
```

Ensure that you update the `dataset_dir` variable in the code to point to the location of your dataset.

## 🧩 Code Explanation

1. **Data Preparation:** The code loads images from the specified directories and prepares data generators for training, validation, and testing 📂.
2. **Model Architecture:** A CNN model with multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers is built 🏗️.
3. **Training:** The model is compiled and trained for 100 epochs 📅.
4. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy is printed 📊.
5. **Visualization:** Accuracy and loss plots are generated to visualize model performance 📈.
6. **Prediction Function:** A function is provided to predict the class of a new image and save the class indices to a JSON file 📝.
7. **Saving the Model:** The trained model is saved as `plant_disease_prediction_model.h5` 💾.

## 🧩 Usage

To use the trained model for making predictions, update the `image_path` variable to the path of the image you want to classify and run the prediction code.

Example:

```python
image_path = 'path/to/test/image.jpg'
predicted_class_name = predict_image_class(model, image_path, class_indices)
print("Predicted Class Name:", predicted_class_name)
```
